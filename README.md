# sciScout

## What is this?

sciScout is the Sciborgs' personalized scouting app for the FRC competition. It's meant to be a simple yet effective version of [eScout](https://github.com/SciBorgs/eScout).

## How is this different from eScout?

eScout is meant to be a scouting app that caters to any team's interests with scouting and strategy. However, this approach requires a lot of the inner-workings of the project to be dynamic, which brings an unimagineable amount of complexity to the project and is unnecessary for our own team. 

While sciScout aims to have a similar featureset to eScout, it does not need to be dynamic for our own purposes, making the development process significantly easier. This project also aims to serve as a project for programming rookies interested in web development to hop into, and respectfully, I feel bad if I had to make eScout their first web development project.

## What stack does this project use?

This project uses the [T3 stack]()

## Are you proud of your project-naming abilities?

Absolutely not. This project name is terrible and will probably change in the near future, but my mind is blank right now and I can't think of a better name.
